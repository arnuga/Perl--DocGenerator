Perl-DocGenerator

This module is my attempt to auto-generate searchable and indexable 
documentation for a work project that spans over 2 million lines of 
perl code.  Frankly I got tired of new hires over the years asking
about docs and having to shrug my shoulders.  I didn't really want
to write the docs myself so I decided that perl might be able to 
help with documenting my perl code.  This module does it's (my) best
at providing documentation about the .pm files you have, what they
include, inherit from, etc.  It should capture functions,
inheritted functions, class methods, packages, package level scalars,
arrays, hashes, etc.  I'm sure it's missing a lot but it's a start,
if you have something better then I'm guessing you wouldn't be reading
this.  I'm very open to patches, comments, suggestions, etc.  Please
direct all complaints to /dev/null.

Side note; I don't do moose so no, this is not a moose/mouse/mice/whatever
class.  I haven't looked at how moose works from an inheritance POV so it
may not work for you if you're into that sorta thing. Besides isn't moose
supposed to be the kitchen sink of "modern perl"? Shouldn't it do this 
already?
